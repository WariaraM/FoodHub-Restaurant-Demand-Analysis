# 🍔 FoodHub Restaurant Demand & Delivery Performance Analysis

This project analyzes order and delivery data for **FoodHub**, a food aggregator platform operating in New York. With a growing number of restaurants and increased customer reliance on online food delivery, FoodHub aims to understand restaurant popularity, delivery efficiency, and customer satisfaction to guide operational and marketing decisions.

## 📌 Objective

As a Data Scientist at FoodHub, your task is to help answer critical business questions by analyzing historical order data. The project covers:

- Identifying top-performing restaurants and cuisines
- Understanding delivery patterns and timing issues
- Evaluating the impact of delivery speed on customer ratings
- Estimating revenue performance from commissions
- Recommending improvements for delivery, marketing, and customer retention

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- The top 5 restaurants received significantly more orders, suggesting higher customer satisfaction, stronger marketing, or both.
- Weekend cuisine preferences revealed popular food types and opportunities for targeted promotions.
- A **clear relationship** was observed: faster delivery times correlated with **higher customer ratings**.
- Revenue calculations exposed major differences in commission performance across restaurants — some generated over $1,000, others less than $10.
- Around **10% of orders took more than 60 minutes**, which is a potential risk to customer satisfaction and efficiency metrics.

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

- **Reduce delivery times over 60 minutes** by optimizing delivery routes and hiring more delivery personnel. Faster delivery boosts ratings and customer retention.
- **Leverage popular weekend cuisines** with targeted promotions and bundled offers to increase weekend order volume.
- **Support high-performing restaurants** with promotional deals and greater visibility to amplify customer trust and order volume.
- **Continuously monitor ratings and feedback** to identify weak points and respond to recurring complaints.
- **Introduce loyalty programs** to reward returning customers and personalize offers based on order history and cuisine preferences.

## 💰 Revenue Analysis

Using order-level commission rates, this project computed the **net revenue** generated by the company. The insight allows strategic focus on high-performing restaurants while flagging underperforming partnerships for evaluation.

## 🧭 Data Ethics & Considerations

- All analyses were performed on anonymized, aggregated data.
- Customer privacy and fairness were maintained throughout the analysis.
- Assumptions about restaurant quality or customer satisfaction were backed by measurable indicators (like delivery times and ratings) — no subjective conclusions were drawn.
